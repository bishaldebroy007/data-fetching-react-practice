# Data Fetching Practice in a React Project

Just practicing what I learned.

I tried practicing fetching data from a JSON file into a React JS component and displaying them using restructuring and mapping.

## Installation

After cloning the project as usual,

Install the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) in the local system.

```bash
npm install
```
## Run the Project
```bash
npm run dev
```
